# kaggle-spring

Our objective in this competition is to predict which previous patrons of our customer, an orchestra, will purchase a season subscription to the upcoming 2014-15 concert season. There are different levels of subscription, but we are simply going to predict whether they will purchase a subscription (of any level) or not. Our client has provided us a number of data files containing useful data on all previous patrons (see "Data" tab for details). We should use this data to generate predictions for the accounts (patrons) listed in the "test.csv" file. In this competition you will be submitting your "soft predictions" (your probabilistic prediction that they will purchase a subscription).

Please refer to the "Kaggle Competition" for [results](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/classical-music-meets-classical-ml-spr2023/overview)

Have fun and good luck!
